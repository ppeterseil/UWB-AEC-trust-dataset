# UWB-AEC-trust-dataset
In our lab-environment we set-up 8 custom DW1000-based UWB anchors, together with one tag. The tag was mounted on the train of a model railway. The railway tracks were adjusted according to the planed trajectory using a laser range finder. A sketch of the floor plan will be added to the repo soon.<br>
